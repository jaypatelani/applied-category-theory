# Introduction
Hi! Welcome to the *GitBook-version of the*  **[Applied Category Theory Course](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/seven-sketches-in-compositionality/)**. The full course exists on the [Azimuth Forum](https://forum.azimuthproject.org/categories/applied-category-theory-course) and this is a collection of the lectures that John Baez posted in the forum, in a GitBook-format.

To begin, you can download a copy of the text:

* Brendan Fong and David Spivak, _[Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf)_. 

Then start reading the lectures.

If you want to actively participate in the course, you can start with
