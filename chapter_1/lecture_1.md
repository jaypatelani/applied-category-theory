# Lecture 1 - Introduction
-----------------------

Welcome to the **[Applied Category Theory
Course](https://forum.azimuthproject.org/discussion/1717/welcome-to-the-applied-category-theory-course)!**
You can register at left using your full real name as username.

I haven't carefully counted, but so far about 150 of you have
registered, and I see 27 more applicants whom I haven't gotten around
to approving. A bunch of you have written self-introductions; I
haven't gotten around to responding to all these yet either - but it's
obvious we've got a formidable team here. If we work together we can
do amazing things.

I decided to teach an online course because I was getting bored of the
superficial engagement I'd been getting on my social media posts,
mainly on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+johncbaez999), which
started out great but has been going downhill. I like to explain
things, discuss things and learn things by talking to people. I've
been doing this for decades, first on
[sci.physics.research](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/), and
later on the [n-Category
Caf&eacute;](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/), the [Azimuth
blog](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/)... and the [Azimuth
Forum](https://forum.azimuthproject.org/discussions) here, which began
life as a platform for creating a wiki about environmental issues: the
[Azimuth Wiki](http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage).
All these fora were great fun, but it seems each one gets a bit stale
after a while, so it's time for something new.

I decided to teach a course on "applied category theory" because
that's what I'm working on, and my former student [Brendan
Fong](http://www.brendanfong.com/) is doing a postdoc with [David
Spivak](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/) at MIT, and they taught a
course on this subject and turned it into a very nice book that you
can download for free:

* Brendan Fong and David Spivak, _[Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf)_.

Our course will be based on this book. I'll give "lectures" on it -
in print, like this one here - from now until at most September 25th,
when I have to start teaching classes at U. C. Riverside again. The
book has 7 chapters, and we've got at most 6 months. I don't have a
set time-table: we'll have to see how things go. We could be done
much sooner, but it may be fun to go slower and get into more detail.

I will try to write a short lecture every day or so, sometimes more
than one. But sometimes I'll be busy: most notably, from April 23rd
to May 5th, Brendan, David and I will be in the Netherlands at
[Applied Category Theory
2018](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/act-2018/),
along with 60 other people, and things will get very hectic. Expect a
slowdown or complete silence then. With luck you can watch videos.

We should do all the exercises in the book. I hope some of you
volunteer to copy these exercises over to the Forum, one at a time, so
we can talk about them here. I'll get the game started but I can't do
everything.

I will also pose Puzzles. In fact I've [already
started](https://forum.azimuthproject.org/discussion/comment/15878/#Comment_15878)!

So, your job is to read the book, ask questions, try to do the
Exercises and Puzzles, write your answers here - and most importantly,
discuss everything to death! There will be a place to discuss each
Chapter, and a place to discuss each Lecture and these discussions can
go on indefinitely.

I will take part in these discussions - that's what I love about
online forums. But if all of you ask lots of questions - and I really
hope you do! - I'll be unable to answer them all myself. So, it's
crucial that _if someone asks a question, and you think you know the
answer, help them out_.

With luck, we'll all learn a lot of stuff, make a lot of new
friends... and some of us will go ahead to revolutionize human
thought, invent amazing new technologies, and save the planet.

**Getting to Know Each Other**

If you're new to the Azimuth Forum, please post a comment about your
interests and background in the category
[Chat](https://forum.azimuthproject.org/categories/Chat). A lot of you
have already done this. So, go read some - and reply to at least one!
Pick one that hasn't gotten any replies yet. I want to go through
them all and reply to every one, but it will take me a while. If you
get to know some other people in the course, it'll be a lot more fun.

I'd like to keep the discussions on Chapters (of the book) and
Lectures (like this) fairly focused. There is always conversation
drift, and some of that is okay, but if you start wanting to talk
about algebraic geometry or sky-diving or something else that's not
really about the course, please take it to
[Chat](https://forum.azimuthproject.org/categories/Chat). That's a
good place for free-wheeling discussions.

**Discussions**

You discuss the Chapters by posting a comment on the appropriate
thread, like this:

* [Chapter 1](https://forum.azimuthproject.org/discussion/1718/chapter-1).

You can discuss my Lectures by posting a comment on _its_ thread. If
you have questions or comments on the subject of the course that don't
quite fit into any of these places, you can start a new discussion in
the category [Applied Category Theory
Course](https://forum.azimuthproject.org/categories/applied-category-theory-course).
If you have questions about technical aspects of how the Azimuth Forum
works - or why it's not working - start a discussion in the category
[Technical](https://forum.azimuthproject.org/categories/Technical).

**Writing math**

You can write equations using
[MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html), which is a
limited version of LaTeX good for the web. For "displayed" equations,
centered on the page, use double dollar signs: `$$E = \sqrt{m^2 +
p^2}$$` produces this:

<center>$$E = \sqrt{m^2 + p^2}$$</center>

For "inline" equations, mixed in with your text, use this other
method: `\\(E = \sqrt{m^2 + p^2}\\)` produces this: \\(E = \sqrt{m^2 +
p^2}\\). If you don't know anything about LaTeX, you can look at the
source code of other people's comments and see how they're doing
stuff.

**Resources**

The book _[Seven
Sketches](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf)_
has a bibliography with some good reference. Wikipedia is actually
very good for [definitions of terms used in category
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_category_theory).
For more advanced material, see the
[nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage). Also try these free
books:

* Tom Leinster, _[Basic Category
 Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375)_, Cambridge Studies in
 Advanced Mathematics, Vol. 143, Cambridge University Press, 2014.
 (An introduction.)

* Emily Riehl, _[Category Theory in
 Context](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf)_, Dover, New
 York, 2016. (More advanced.)

**Be nice**

It's an inevitable feature of any discussion forum that some users
become rude, bully others, try to take over conversations, or try to
promote irrelevant ideas. Anyone who becomes annoying in these or
other ways will be banned. I won't allow discussions about these
issues, either. I have been helping run online discussion forums
since around 1989, back when we used modems, and I've learned that
requiring politeness is the only way to keep attention focused on the
actual subject matter. If you don't want to be polite and respectful
of others, please leave now.

Pro tip: if someone says something idiotic, like "all categories have
colimits", don't say "You're wrong." Say "Actually not all categories
have colimits: consider for example the category of free groups and
homomorphisms between those." It's amazing how much better people
respond when they don't perceive a correction as being _an attack on
their person_. People are incredibly sensitive things.
