A bunch of you have written self-introductions; I\nhaven't gotten around to responding to all these yet either - but it's\nobvious we've got a formidable team here. If we work together we can\ndo amazing things.\nI decided to teach an online course because I was getting bored of the\nsuperficial engagement I'd been getting on my social media posts,\nmainly on Google+, which\nstarted out great but has been going downhill. I like to explain\nthings, discuss things and learn things by talking to people. I've\nbeen doing this for decades, first on\nsci.physics.research, and\nlater on the n-Category\nCaf√©, the Azimuth\nblog... and the Azimuth\nForum here, which began\nlife as a platform for creating a wiki about environmental issues: the\nAzimuth Wiki.\nAll these fora were great fun, but it seems each one gets a bit stale\nafter a while, so it's time for something new.\nI decided to teach a course on \"applied category theory\" because\nthat's what I'm working on, and my former student Brendan\nFong is doing a postdoc with David\nSpivak at MIT, and they taught a\ncourse on this subject and turned it into a very nice book that you\ncan download for free:\n\nBrendan Fong and David Spivak, Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory.\n\nOur course will be based on this book. I'll give \"lectures\" on it -\nin print, like this one here - from now until at most September 25th,\nwhen I have to start teaching classes at U. C. Riverside again. The\nbook has 7 chapters, and we've got at most 6 months. I don't have a\nset time-table: we'll have to see how things go. We could be done\nmuch sooner, but it may be fun to go slower and get into more detail.\nI will try to write a short lecture every day or so, sometimes more\nthan one. But sometimes I'll be busy: most notably, from April 23rd\nto May 5th, Brendan, David and I will be in the Netherlands at\nApplied Category Theory\n2018,\nalong with 60 other people, and things will get very hectic. Expect a\nslowdown or complete silence then. With luck you can watch videos.\nWe should do all the exercises in the book. I hope some of you\nvolunteer to copy these exercises over to the Forum, one at a time, so\nwe can talk about them here. I'll get the game started but I can't do\neverything.\nI will also pose Puzzles. In fact I've already\nstarted!\nSo, your job is to read the book, ask questions, try to do the\nExercises and Puzzles, write your answers here - and most importantly,\ndiscuss everything to death! There will be a place to discuss each\nChapter, and a place to discuss each Lecture and these discussions can\ngo on indefinitely.\nI will take part in these discussions - that's what I love about\nonline forums. But if all of you ask lots of questions - and I really\nhope you do! - I'll be unable to answer them all myself. So, it's\ncrucial that if someone asks a question, and you think you know the\nanswer, help them out.\nWith luck, we'll all learn a lot of stuff, make a lot of new\nfriends... and some of us will go ahead to revolutionize human\nthought, invent amazing new technologies, and save the planet.\nGetting to Know Each Other\nIf you're new to the Azimuth Forum, please post a comment about your\ninterests and background in the category\nChat. A lot of you\nhave already done this. So, go read some - and reply to at least one!\nPick one that hasn't gotten any replies yet. I want to go through\nthem all and reply to every one, but it will take me a while. If you\nget to know some other people in the course, it'll be a lot more fun.\nI'd like to keep the discussions on Chapters (of the book) and\nLectures (like this) fairly focused. There is always conversation\ndrift, and some of that is okay, but if you start wanting to talk\nabout algebraic geometry or sky-diving or something else that's not\nreally about the course, please take it to\nChat. That's a\ngood place for free-wheeling discussions.\nDiscussions\nYou discuss the Chapters by posting a comment on the appropriate\nthread, like this:\n\nChapter 1.\n\nYou can discuss my Lectures by posting a comment on its thread. If\nyou have questions or comments on the subject of the course that don't\nquite fit into any of these places, you can start a new discussion in\nthe category Applied Category Theory\nCourse.\nIf you have questions about technical aspects of how the Azimuth Forum\nworks - or why it's not working - start a discussion in the category\nTechnical.\nWriting math\nYou can write equations using\nMathJax, which is a\nlimited version of LaTeX good for the web. For \"displayed\" equations,\ncentered on the page, use double dollar signs: {% math %}E = \\sqrt{m^2 +\np^2}{% endmath %} produces this:\nE = \\sqrt{m^2 + p^2}\nFor \"inline\" equations, mixed in with your text, use this other\nmethod: \\\\(E = \\sqrt{m^2 + p^2}\\\\) produces this: \\(E = \\sqrt{m^2 +\np^2}\\). If you don't know anything about LaTeX, you can look at the\nsource code of other people's comments and see how they're doing\nstuff.\nResources\nThe book Seven\nSketches\nhas a bibliography with some good reference.

While I can point you to some\ngreat applications of category theory outside mathematics and computer\nscience, if you ask \"have categories been successfully applied to X?\"\nthere's a high chance the answer will be no, even if such an\napplication is possible!  It takes time.\nCategory theory was created in 1947. It was created to be\napplied. Mathematicians were having problems connecting topology to\nalgebra, and Eilenberg and Mac Lane realized that 3 new concepts were\nrequired to solve these problems: category, functor, and natural\ntransformation. They succeeded wonderfully, and category theory\nstarted growing rapidly: it is now indispensable in the subject of\n\"algebraic topology\", which solves topology problems using algebra.\nLater Grothendieck applied category theory to \"algebraic geometry\",\nand used it to prove the Weil Conjectures, some amazing conjectures\nrelating number theory to geometry. In the process he invented many\nother fundamental concepts, like topoi, or toposes. By now category\ntheory is a very large subject that takes a long time to thoroughly\nlearn.\nHowever, these are applications within pure mathematics, and the new\nbuzzword \"applied category theory\" refers to applications outside\npure mathematics.\nIt also mainly means applications outside computer science.\nCategory theory has been applied to computer science for a long time\nnow, at least since the 1960s. That's why a lot of you - maybe even\nmost of you - are hackers, programmers, software designers, or\ncomputer scientists. You've heard that category theory is good for\nyou. You probably heard that before the new buzzword \"applied\ncategory theory\".\nI'm not a programmer. I apologize for this flaw. I know a fair\namount about categories in computer science - but I learned it from\nthe category theory side, not from hands-on experience in programming.\nFor example, I understood monads before I heard of Haskell, and my\nfirst reaction was \"What are these guys doing with monads?  How are\nthey managing to make such a simple concept so mysterious?\"  I\nunderstood cartesian closed categories before I understood the lambda\ncalculus, and I can't imagine myself understanding the lambda calculus\nwithout category theory (though plenty of people do).\nSo, this is not a course on \"categories in computer science\".\nNonetheless, because category theory is about understanding and\norganizing abstract data structures, everything I say will be relevant\nin some way to computing! Furthermore, several chapters in Seven\nSketches explicitly discuss databases, and type systems, and other\naspects of computer science.\nIn the 1990s people started applying category theory to quantum\nphysics, and quantum gravity. That's how I got interested in category\ntheory! There are a lot of success stories here by now. And if people\nsucceed in building topological quantum\ncomputers,\nwe'll see technology that can only be understood using category\ntheory.\nMore recently, some of us decided that if categories are good for\ncomputer science and physics, maybe we should apply them elsewhere:\nengineering, chemistry, biology and beyond. That's what I'm doing\nnow. I'm applying categories in the DARPA-funded project on complex\nadaptive system\ndesign,\nI'm being paid by the Silicon Valley startup\nPyrofex to\ndo research in category theory, and I've got 8 grad students and a\npostdoc studying networks\nusing category theory.  And it's not just us - it's catching on.\nIt's this incipient spread of category theory into many areas of\nscience and engineering that people mean when they say \"applied\ncategory theory\".\nI held a workshop on it last year. You can see slides and videos here:\n\nApplied Category Theory,\nAMS Western Sectional Meeting, U. C. Riverside, 4-5 November 2017.\n\nThis month Spencer\nBreiner and Eswaran\nSubrahmanian\nran a workshop pulling together academics and lots of honchos from\nindustry and government:\n\nApplied Category Theory: Bridging Theory &\nPractice,\n15-16 March 2018, National Institute of Standards and Technology,\nGaithersburg, Maryland, USA.\n\nThey took videos and collected talk slides, but for now you can only\nread my description - click the link.\nAt the end of April there will be a much bigger week-long school\nfollowed by a week-long workshop in the Netherlands:\n\nApplied Category Theory (ACT 2018).\nSchool\n23-27 April 2018 and\nworkshop\n30 April-4 May 2018 at the a\nhref=\"https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/\"Lorentz Center in Leiden,\nthe Netherlands.  Organized by a\nhref=\"http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bob.coecke/\"Bob Coecke (Oxford),\nBrendan Fong (MIT), a\nhref=\"http://www.cs.ru.nl/A.Kissinger/\"Aleks Kissinger\n(Nijmegen), a\nhref=\"https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/martha.lewis/\"Martha Lewis\n(Amsterdam), and Joshua\nTan (Oxford).\n\nThere should be a lot to see on YouTube! I'll be there, and I'll keep\nyou informed.\nThese are all the events I know that have \"applied category theory\"\nin the title. The applications have been building up over decades, but\nonly now have they reached a critical mass, to make it a subject with\nits own name.\nThe book by Fong and Spivak is a great introduction to category theory\nas viewed from this new perspective. So that's what we'll talk about\nhere!\nClick here to read the original\ndiscussion\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_3.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_3.html","title":"Lecture 3 - Posets","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 3 - Posets\n\nOkay, let's get started!\nFong and Spivak start out by explaining posets, which is short for\n\"partially ordered sets\".  Whenever you have a set of things and a\nreasonable way deciding when anything in that set is \"bigger\" than\nsome other thing, or \"more expensive\", or \"taller\", or \"heavier\", or\n\"better\" in any well-defined sense, or... anything like that, you've\ngot a poset.  When \\(y\\) is bigger than \\(x\\) we write \\(x \\le\ny\\).  (You can also write \\(y \\ge x\\), of course.)\nWhat do I mean by \"reasonable\"?  We demand that the \\(\\le\\) relation\nobey these rules:\n\nreflexivity: \\(x \\le x\\)\n\ntransitivity \\(x \\le y\\) and \\(y \\le z\\) imply \\(x \\le\nz\\).\n\n\nA set with a relation obeying these rules is called a\npreorder.\nThis is a fundamental concept!  After all, humans are always busy\ntrying to compare things and see what's better.  So, we'll start by\nstudying preorders.\nBut I can't resist revealing a secret trick that Fong and Spivak are\nplaying on you here.  Why in the world should a book on applied\ncategory theory start by discussing preorders?  Why not start by\ndiscussing categories?\nThe answer: a preorder is an especially simple kind of category.  A\ncategory, as you may have heard, has a bunch of 'objects'\n\\(x,y,z,\\dots\\) and 'morphisms' between them.  A morphism from\n\\(x\\) to \\(y\\) is written \\(f : x \\to y\\).  You can 'compose' a\nmorphism from \\(f : x \\to y\\) with a morphism from \\(g: y \\to z\\)\nand get a morphism \\(gf : x \\to z\\).  Every object \\(x\\) has an\n'identity' morphism \\(1_x : x \\to x\\).  And a few simple rules must\nhold.  We'll get into them later.\nBut a category with at most one morphism from any object \\(x\\) to\nany object \\(y\\) is really just a preorder!  If there's a morphism\nfrom \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) we simply write \\(x \\le y\\).  We don't need\nto give the morphism a name because there's at most one from \\(x\\)\nto \\(y\\).\nSo, the study of preorders is a baby version of category theory, where\neverything gets much easier!  And when Fong and Spivak are teaching\nyou about preorders, they're sneakily getting you used to categories.\nThen, when they introduce categories explicitly, you can always fall\nback on preorders as examples.\nI've posted 4 puzzles on preorders\nhere.\nLook at them!  I just answered Puzzle 3.  Puzzle 4 has millions of\nanswers - come up with another!  Also look at Puzzle 5\nhere.\nAnd people who already know the definition of a category, and want to\nponder how preorders are a special case of categories, should try\nPuzzles 6 and 7\nhere.\nClick here to read the original\ndiscussion.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_4.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_4.html","title":"Lecture 4 - Galois Connections","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 4 - Galois Connections\n\nOkay, now let's get to the cool part: Galois connections. Before he\ndied in a duel, the young √âvariste\nGalois proved\nthat you couldn't solve the quintic equation with radicals: that is,\nthere's nothing like the quadratic formula for equations like\nax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f = 0.\nHe used a trick for converting one view of a problem into another, and\nthen converting the other view back into the original one. And by\nnow, we've extracted the essence of this trick and dubbed it a \"Galois\nconnection\". It's far more general than Galois dreamed.\nRemember, a preorder is\na set \\(A\\) with a relation \\(\\le_A\\) that's reflexive and\ntransitive. When we're in the mood for being careful, we write a\npreorder as a pair \\( (A,\\le_A)\\). When we're feeling lazy we'll\njust call it something like \\(A\\), and just write \\(\\le\\) for the\nrelation.\nDefinition. Given preorders \\((A,\\le_A)\\) and \\((B,\\le_B)\\), a\nmonotone map from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is a function \\(f : A \\to\nB\\) such that\n x \\le_A y \\textrm{ implies } f(x) \\le_B f(y) . \nfor all elements \\(x,y \\in A\\),\nPuzzle 10. There are many examples of monotone maps between\nposets.  List a few interesting ones!\nDefinition. Given preorders \\((A,\\le_A)\\) and \\((B,\\le_B)\\), a\nGalois\nconnection is a\nmonotone map \\(f : A \\to B\\) together with a monotone map \\(g: B\n\\to A\\) such that\n f(a) \\le_B b  \\textrm{ if and only if } a \\le_A g(b) \nfor all \\(a \\in A, b \\in B\\). In this situation we call \\(f\\) the\nleft adjoint and \\(g\\) the right adjoint.\nSo, the right adjoint of \\(f\\) is a way of going back from \\(B\\)\nto \\(A\\) that's related to \\(f\\) in some way.\nPuzzle 11. Show that if the monotone map \\(f: A \\to B\\) has an\ninverse \\(g : B \\to A \\) that is also a monotone map, then \\(g\\)\nis both a right adjoint and a left adjoint of \\(f\\).\nSo, adjoints are some sort of generalization of inverses. But as\nyou'll eventually see, they're much more exciting!\nI will spend quite a few lectures describing really interesting\nexamples, and you'll start seeing what Galois connections are good\nfor. It shouldn't be obvious yet, unless you already happen to know or\nyou're some sort of superhuman genius. I just want to get the\ndefinition on the table right away.\nHere's one easy example to get you started. Let \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) be\nthe set of natural numbers with its usual notion of \\(\\le\\).\nThere's a function \\(f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(f(x) =\n2x \\). This function doesn't have an inverse. But:\nPuzzle 12. Find a right adjoint for \\(f\\): that is, a function\n\\(g : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\) with\n  f(m) \\le n  \\textrm{ if and only if } m \\le  g(n) \nfor all \\(m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).

But now it's time to\nexplain why they matter. This will take much longer - and be much more\nfun.\nGalois connections do something really cool: they tell you the best\npossible way to recover data that can't be recovered.\nMore precisely, they tell you the best approximation to reversing a\ncomputation that can't be reversed.\nSomeone hands you the output of some computation, and asks you what\nthe input was.  Sometimes there's a unique right answer.  But\nsometimes there's more than one answer, or none!  That's when your job\ngets hard.  In fact, impossible!  But don't let that stop you.\n\n\nSuppose we have a function between sets, \\(f : A \\to B\\). We say a\nfunction \\(g: B \\to A \\) is the inverse of \\(f\\) if\n   g(f(a)) = a \\textrm{ for all } a \\in A  \\quad \\textrm{ and } \\quad f(g(b)) = b \\textrm{ for all } b \\in B\nAnother equivalent way to say this is that\n f(a) = b  \\textrm{ if and only if } a =  g(b) \nfor all \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(b \\in B\\).\nSo, the idea is that \\(g\\) undoes \\(f\\). For example, if \\(A = B\n= \\mathbb{R}\\) is the set of real numbers, and \\(f\\) doubles every\nnumber, then \\(f\\) has an inverse \\(g\\), which halves every\nnumber.\nBut what if \\(A = B = \\mathbb{N}\\) is the set of natural numbers,\nand \\(f\\) doubles every natural number. This function has no\ninverse!\nSo, if I say \"\\(2a = 4\\); tell me \\(a\\)\" you can say \\(a = 2\\).\nBut if I say \"\\(2a = 3\\); tell me \\(a\\)\" you're stuck.\nBut you can still try to give me a \"best approximation\" to the\nnonexistent natural number \\(a\\) with \\(2 a = 3\\).\n\"Best\" in what sense? We could look for the number \\(a\\) that makes\n\\(2a\\) as close as possible to 3. There are two equally good\noptions: \\(a = 1\\) and \\(a = 2\\). Here we are using the usual\ndistance function, or\nmetric), on\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\), which says that the distance between \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) is \\(|x-y|\\).\nBut we're not talking about distance functions in this class now!\nWe're talking about preorders. Can we define a \"best approximation\"\nusing just the relation \\(\\le\\) on \\(\\mathbb{N}\\)?\nYes!  But we can do it in two ways!\nBest approximation from below. Find the largest possible \\(a \\in\n\\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\(2a \\le 3\\). Answer: \\(a = 1\\).\nBest approximation from above. Find the smallest possible \\(a \\in\n\\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\(3 \\le 2a\\). Answer: \\(a = 2\\).\nOkay, now work this out more generally:\nPuzzle 14. Find the function \\(g : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\)\nsuch that \\(g(b) \\) is the largest possible natural number \\(a\\)\nwith \\(2a \\le b\\).\nPuzzle 15. Find the function \\(g : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\)\nsuch that \\(g(b)\\) is the smallest possible natural number \\(a\\)\nwith \\(b \\le 2a\\).\nNow think about Lecture 4 and the puzzles there! I'll\ncopy them here with notation that better matches what I'm using now:\nPuzzle 12. Find a right adjoint for the function \\(f: \\mathbb{N}\n\\to \\mathbb{N}\\) that doubles natural numbers: that is, a function\n\\(g : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\) with\n  f(a) \\le b  \\textrm{ if and only if } a \\le  g(b) \nfor all \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\nPuzzle 13.

But now let's\nreview these puzzles and extract some valuable lessons!\nWe took the function \\(f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\) that doubles\nany natural number\nf(a) = 2a .\n\nThis function has no inverse, since you can't divide an odd number by\n2 and get a natural number!

The right adjoint comes as close as possible while\nmaking sure to never choose a number that's too big.\nThe two adjoints represent two opposing philosophies of life: make\nsure you never ask for too little and make sure you never ask for\ntoo much. This is why they're philosophically profound. But the great\nthing is that they are defined in a completely precise, systematic way\nthat applies to a huge number of situations!\nIf you need a mnemonic to remember which is which, remember left\nadjoints are \"left-wing\" or \"liberal\" or \"generous\", while right\nadjoints are \"right-wing\" or \"conservative\" or \"cautious\".\nLet's think a bit more about how we can compute them in general,\nstarting from the basic definition.\nHere's the definition again. Suppose we have two preorders\n\\((A,\\le_A)\\) and \\((B,\\le_B)\\) and a monotone function \\(f : A\n\\to B\\).  Then we say a monotone function \\(g: B \\to A\\) is a\nright adjoint of \\(f\\) if\n  f(a) \\le_B b  \\textrm{ if and only if } a \\le_A g(b) \n\nfor all \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(b \\in B\\). In this situation we also say\nthat \\(f\\) is a left adjoint of \\(g\\).\nThe names should be easy to remember, since \\(f\\) shows up on the\nleft of the inequality \\( f(a) \\leB b \\), while \\(g\\) shows up\non the _right of the inequality \\( a \\le_A g(b) \\).  But let's see\nhow they actually work!\nSuppose you know \\(f : A \\to B\\) and you're trying to figure out its\nright adjoint \\(g: B \\to A\\). Say you're trying to figure out\n\\(g(b)\\). You don't know what it is, but you know\n  f(a) \\le_B b  \\textrm{ if and only if } a \\le_A g(b) \n\nSo, you go around looking at choices of \\(a \\in A\\).  For each one\nyou compute \\(f(a)\\).  If \\(f(a) \\le_B b\\), then you know \\(a\n\\le_A g(b)\\).  So, you need to choose \\(g(b)\\) to be greater than\nor equal to every element of this set:\n   \\{a  \\in A : \\; f(a) \\le_B b  \\}  \n\nIn other words, \\(g(b)\\) must be an upper\nbound of this\nset.  But you shouldn't choose \\(g(b)\\) to be any bigger than it\nneeds to be! After all, you know \\(a \\leA g(b)\\) _only if \\(f(a)\n\\le_B b\\). So, \\(g(b)\\) must be a least upper\nbound of the\nabove set.\nNote that I'm carefully speaking about a least upper bound. Our set\ncould have two different least upper bounds, say \\(a\\) and \\(a'\\).\nSince they're both the least, we must have \\(a \\le a'\\) and \\(a'\n\\le a\\). This doesn't imply \\(a = a'\\), in general! But it does if\nour preorder \\(A\\) is a \"poset\". A poset is a preorder \\((A,\n\\le_A)\\) obeying this extra axiom:\n  \\textrm{ if } a \\le a'  \\textrm{ and } a' \\le a \\textrm{ then } a = a' \n\nfor all \\(a,a' \\in A\\).\nIn a poset, our desired least upper bound may still not exist. But\nif it does, it's unique, and Fong and Spivak write it this way:\n  \\bigvee \\{a  \\in A : \\; f(a) \\le_B b  \\}  \n\nThe \\(\\bigvee\\) symbol stands for \"least upper bound\", also known as\nsupremum or join.\nSo, here's what we've shown:\nIf \\(f : A \\to B\\) has a right adjoint \\(g : B \\to A\\) and \\(A\\)\nis a poset, this right adjoint is unique and we have a formula for it:\n  g(b) =  \\bigvee \\{a  \\in A : \\; f(a) \\le_B b  \\} . \n\nAnd we can copy our whole line of reasoning and show this:\nIf \\(g : B \\to A\\) has a left adjoint \\(f : A \\to B\\) and \\(B\\)\nis a poset, this left adjoint is unique and we have a formula for it:\n  f(a) =  \\bigwedge \\{b  \\in B : \\; a \\le_A g(b)   \\}  .\n\nHere the \\(\\bigwedge\\) symbol stands for \"greatest lower bound\",\nalso known as the infimum or meet.\nWe're making progress: we can now actually compute left and right\nadjoints! Next we'll start looking at more examples.\nClick here to read the original discussion.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_7.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_7.html","title":"Lecture 7 - Logic","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 7 - Logic\n\nSo far the only examples of posets I've talked about in the lectures are the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) with their usual order \\(\\le\\).  Of course every natural number is a real number, so there's a function\n   i : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R} \nsending any natural number \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) to the exact same number regarded as a real number.  This function is monotone, so you now know instinctively to ask this question:\nPuzzle 21. Does the monotone function \\(i : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) have a left adjoint?  Does it have a right adjoint?  If so, what are they?\nThis is nice, but we need to look at other examples to appreciate the diversity of posets.  Both  \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) have a very special property.   They are totally ordered sets: posets such that\n   \\textrm{ for all } x, y,  \\textrm{ either } x \\le y \\textrm{ or } y \\le x . \nIf you want to show off, you can call totally ordered sets tosets.   They're also called linearly ordered, because you can imagine them as lines:\n\n\nTotally ordered sets are limiting.   Suppose you're trying to order foods on a restaurant menu based on how much you like them.   What's better: a cheese sandwich or a pancake?   There may be no answer, because you like them in different ways.   To get a totally ordered set you have to ignore this and arrange all the foods in a line.   \nIn standard economics we do try to arrange everything in a line.  We measure the worth of everything in real numbers: numbers of dollars.   There's even a theorem to justify this, proved by von Neumann and Morgenstern.  But the assumptions of this theorem don't hold in real life.  It's mainly just convenient to measure value, or \"utility\", in real numbers.  With computer technologies we could set up cryptocurrencies based on other posets.  But will we?\nLuckily, human thought as a whole is not limited to total orders.  A good example is logic.  Logic, in its simplest form, is about statements \\(P, Q, R, \\dots \\) and whether one statement implies another.  If \\(P\\) implies \\(Q\\) we often write \\(P \\implies Q\\).    There are many kinds of logic, but every kind I know, this relation \\(\\implies\\)  makes statements into a preorder, since we have\n1)  reflexivity: \\(P \\implies P\\)\n2)  transitivity: if \\(P \\implies Q\\) and \\( Q \\implies R \\) then \\(P \\implies R\\).\nOften people make this preorder into a poset by imposing this rule:\n3) antisymmetry: if \\(P \\implies Q\\) and \\(Q \\implies P\\) then \\(P = Q \\).\nThis amounts to decreeing that we count two statements as \"the same\" if they both imply each other.  We may not always want to do this.    And we certainly don't want a linear order: it's easy to find examples of statements such that neither \\( P \\implies Q\\) nor \\(Q \\implies P\\), like \"I am a millionaire\" and \"I am happy\", or \"I like this food for breakfast\" and \"I like this food for lunch\".\nSo, to continue our study of preorders, posets, monotone functions and Galois connections, we'll turn to logic!  Category-theoretic logic is an enormous wonderful field, but we'll just do a bit of logic based on the poset of subsets of a set, followed by a bit of logic based on the poset of partitions of a set.   The latter underlies Fong and Spivak's discussion of \"generative effects\" in Chapter 1.\nClick here to read the original discussion.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_8.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_8.html","title":"Lecture 8 - The Logic of Subsets","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 8 - The Logic of Subsets\n\nI'd like to tell you about two kinds of logic.   In both, we start with a set \\( X \\) of \"ways the world can be\" and build a set of statements about the world, also known as \"propositions\".   In the first, propositions correspond to subsets of \\( X \\).  In the second, propositions correspond to partitions of \\( X \\).  In both approaches we get a poset of propositions where the partial order is \"implication\", written \\( \\implies \\).    \nThe first kind of logic is very familiar.  We could call it \"subset logic\", but it's part of what people usually call \"classical logic\".  This is the sort of logic we learn in school, assuming we learn any at all.    The second kind of logic is less well known: it's called \"partition logic\".   Interestingly, Fong and Spivak spend more time on the second kind.  \nI'll start by talking about the first kind.   \nMost of us learn the relation between propositions and subsets, at least implicitly, when we meet Venn diagrams:\n\n\nThis is a picture of some set \\( X \\) of \"ways the world can be\".  But the world here is very tiny: it's just a letter.  It can be any letter in the Latin, Greek or Cyrillic alphabet.  Each region in the Venn diagram is subset of \\( X \\): for example, the upper left circle contains all the letters in the Greek alphabet.  But each region can also be seen as a proposition: a statement about the world.   For example, the upper left circle corresponds to the proposition \"The letter belongs to the Greek alphabet\".      \nAs a result, everything you can do with subsets of \\( X \\) turns into something you can do with propositions.  Suppose \\( P, Q, \\) and \\( R \\) are subsets of \\( X \\).   We can also think of these as propositions, and:\n\nif \\( P \\subseteq Q \\) we say the proposition \\( P \\) implies the proposition \\( Q \\), and we write \\( P \\implies Q \\).\n\nIf \\( P \\cap Q = R \\) we say \\(P \\textbf { and } Q =  R \\).\n\nIf \\( P \\cup Q = R \\) we say the proposition \\( P \\textbf{ o r}  Q = R \\).\n\n\nAll the rules obeyed by \"subset\", \"and\" and \"or\" become rules obeyed by \"implies\", \"and\" and \"or\".  \nI hope you know this already, but if you don't, you're in luck: this is this most important thing you've heard all year!   Please think about it and ask questions until it revolutionizes the way you think about logic.  \nBut really, all this stuff is about one particular way of getting a poset from the set \\( X \\).  \nFor any set \\( X \\) the power set of \\( X \\) is the collection of all subsets of \\( X \\).    We call it \\( PX \\).   It's a poset, where the partial ordering is \\( \\subseteq \\).    \nFor example, here is a picture of the poset \\( P X \\) when \\( X = {x,y,z} \\):\n\n\nAs you can see, it looks like a 3-dimensional cube.  Here's a picture of \\( P X \\) when \\( X \\) has 4 elements:\n\n\nIn this picture we say whether each element is in or out of the subset by writing a 1 or 0.  This time we get a 4-dimensional cube.\nWhat's the union of two subsets \\( S, T \\subseteq X \\)?   It's the smallest subset of \\( X \\)  that contains both \\( S \\) and \\( T \\) as subsets.   This is an example of a concept we can define in any poset:\nDefinition. Given a poset \\( (A, \\le) \\), the join of \\( a, b \\in A \\), if it exists, is the least element \\( c \\in A \\) such that \\( a \\le c \\) and \\( b \\le c \\).   We denote the join of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as \\( a \\vee b \\).    \nQuite generally we can try to think of any poset as a poset of propositions.  Then \\( \\vee \\) means \"or\".  In the logic we're studying today, this poset is \\( P X \\) and \\( \\vee \\) is just \"union\", or \\( \\cup \\).\nSimilarly, what's the intersection of two subsets \\( S, T \\subseteq X \\)?  Well, it's the largest subset of \\( X \\) that is contained as a subset of both \\( S \\) and \\( T \\).   Again this is an example of a concept we can define in any poset:\nDefinition. Given a poset \\( (A, \\le) \\), the meet of \\( a, b \\in A \\), if it exists, is the greatest element \\( c \\in A \\) such that \\( c \\le a \\) and \\( c \\le b \\).   We denote the meet of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as \\( a \\wedge b \\).    \nWhen we think of a poset as a poset of propositions,  \\( \\wedge \\) means \"and\".  When our poset is \\( P X \\), \\( \\wedge \\) is just \"intersection\".  \\( \\cap \\).\nWe could go on with this, and if this were a course on classical logic I would.  But this is a course on applied category theory!  So, we shouldn't just stick with a fixed set \\( X \\).  We should see what happens when we let it vary!    We get a poset of propositions for each set \\( X \\), but all these posets are related to each other.  \nI'll talk about this more next time, but let me give you a teaser now.  Say we have two sets \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) and a function \\( f : X \\to Y \\).  Then we get a monotone map from the poset \\( P Y \\) to the poset \\( P X \\), called\n   f^* : P Y \\to P X \nFor any \\( S \\in P Y \\), the set \\( f^*(S) \\in PX \\) is defined like this:\n  f^*(S) = \\{ x \\in X : \\; f(x) \\in S \\} \nNext time, I'll show you this monotone map has both a left and a right adjoint!  And these turn out to be connected to the logical concepts of \"there exists\" and \"for all\".   I believe this was first discovered by the great category theorist Bill Lawvere.\nSo you see, I haven't given up talking about left and right adjoints.  I'm really just getting ready to explain how they show up in logic: first in good old classical \"subset logic\", and then in the weird new \"partition logic\".\nTo read other lectures go here.\nClick here to read the original discussion.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_9.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_9.html","title":"Lecture 9 - Adjoints and the Logic of Subsets","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 9 - Adjoints and the Logic of Subsets\n\nWe've seen that classical logic is closely connected to the logic of\nsubsets.  For any set \\( X \\) we get a poset \\( PX \\), the power\nset of \\(X\\), whose elements are subsets of \\(X\\), with the\npartial order being \\( \\subseteq \\).  If \\( X \\) is a set of\n\"states\" of the world, elements of \\( P X \\) are \"propositions\"\nabout the world.  Less grandiosely, if \\( X \\) is the set of states\nof any system, elements of \\( PX \\) are propositions about that\nsystem.\nThis trick turns logical operations on propositions - like \"and\" and\n\"or\" - into operations on subsets, like intersection \\(\\cap\\) and\nunion \\(\\cup\\).  And these operations are then special cases of\nthings we can do in other posets, too, like join \\(\\vee\\) and meet\n\\(\\wedge\\).\nWe could march much further in this direction.  I won't, but try it\nyourself!\nPuzzle 22. What operation on subsets corresponds to the logical\noperation \"not\"?  Describe this operation in the language of posets,\nso it has a chance of generalizing to other posets.  Based on your\ndescription, find some posets that do have a \"not\" operation and\nsome that don't.\nI want to march in another direction.  Suppose we have a function\n\\(f : X \\to Y\\) between sets.  This could describe an observation,\nor measurement.  For example, \\( X \\) could be the set of states\nof your room, and \\( Y \\) could be the set of states of a\nthermometer in your room: that is, thermometer readings.  Then for any\nstate \\( x \\) of your room there will be a thermometer reading, the\ntemperature of your room, which we can call \\( f(x) \\).\nThis should yield some function between \\( PX \\), the set of\npropositions about your room, and \\( PY \\), the set of propositions\nabout your thermometer.  It does.  But in fact there are three such\nfunctions!  And they're related in a beautiful way!\nThe most fundamental is this:\nDefinition. Suppose \\(f : X \\to Y \\) is a function between sets.\nFor any \\( S \\subseteq Y \\) define its inverse image#Inverse_image)\nunder \\(f\\) to be\n f^{\\ast}(S) = \\{x \\in X: \\; f(x) \\in S\\} . \nThe pullback is a subset of \\( X \\).\nThe inverse image is also called the preimage, and it's often written as \\(f^{-1}(S)\\).  That's okay, but I won't do that: I don't want to fool you into thinking \\(f\\) needs to have an inverse \\( f^{-1} \\) - it doesn't.   Also, I want to match the notation in Example 1.89 of Seven Sketches.\nThe inverse image gives a monotone function\n  f^{\\ast}: PY \\rightarrow PX, \nsince if \\(S,T \\in PY\\) and \\(S \\subseteq T \\) then\n  f^{\\ast}(S) = \\{x \\in X: \\; f(x) \\in S\\}\n \\subseteq \\{x \\in X:\\; f(x) \\in T\\}\n  = f^{\\ast}(T) .\nWhy is this so fundamental?  Simple: in our example, propositions about the state of your thermometer give propositions about the state of your room!  If the thermometer says it's 35¬∞, then your room is 35¬∞, at least near your thermometer.    Propositions about the measuring apparatus are useful because they give propositions about the system it's measuring - that's what measurement is all about!   This explains the \"backwards\" nature of the function \\(f^{\\ast}: PY \\rightarrow PX\\), going back from \\(PY\\) to \\(PX\\).\nPropositions about the system being measured also give propositions about the measurement apparatus, but this is more tricky.  What does \"there's a living cat  in my room\" tell us about the temperature I read on my thermometer?   This is a bit confusing... but there is an answer because a function \\(f\\) really does also give a \"forwards\" function from \\(PX \\) to \\(PY\\).  Here it is:\nDefinition. Suppose \\(f : X \\to Y \\) is a function between sets.   For any \\( S \\subseteq X \\) define its image#Image_of_a_subset) under \\(f\\) to be\nf_{!}(S) = \\{y \\in Y: \\; y = f(x) \\textrm{ for some } x \\in S\\} .\nThe image is a subset of \\( Y \\).\nThe image is often written as \\(f(S)\\), but I'm using the notation of Seven Sketches, which comes from category theory.   People pronounce \\(f_{!}\\) as \"\\(f\\) lower shriek\".\nThe image gives a monotone function\n  f_{!}: PX \\rightarrow PY \nsince if  \\(S,T \\in PX\\) and \\(S \\subseteq T \\) then\n\nf_{!}(S) = \\{y \\in Y: \\;  y = f(x) \\textrm{ for some } x \\in S \\}\n                \\subseteq  \\{y \\in Y:  \\; y = f(x) \\textrm{ for some } x \\in T \\}\n               =  f_{!}(T) . \nBut here's the cool part:\nTheorem.  \\(  f_{!}: PX \\rightarrow PY \\) is the left adjoint of \\(   f^{\\ast}: PX \\rightarrow PY \\).\nProof.   We need to show that for any \\(S \\subseteq X\\) and \\(T \\subseteq Y\\) we have\n    f_{!}(S) \\subseteq T \\textrm{ if and only if }  S \\subseteq f^{\\ast}(T)  . \nDavid Tanzer gave a quick proof in Puzzle 19.   It goes like this: \\(f_{!}(S) \\subseteq T\\) is true if and only if \\(f\\) maps elements of \\(S\\) to elements of \\(T\\), which is true if and only if  \\( S \\subseteq {x \\in X: \\; f(x) \\in T} =  f^{\\ast}(T) \\).  \\(\\quad \\blacksquare\\)\nThis is great!  But there's also another way to go forwards from \\(PX\\) to \\(PY\\), which is a right adjoint of \\(  f^{\\ast}: PY \\rightarrow PX \\).   This is less widely known, and I don't even know a simple name for it.   Apparently it's less useful.\nDefinition. Suppose \\(f : X \\to Y \\) is a function between sets.   For any \\( S \\subseteq X \\) define\nf_{\\ast}(S) = \\{y \\in Y:  x \\in S \\textrm{ for all } x \\textrm{ such that } y = f(x)\\} .\nThis is a subset of \\(Y \\).\nPuzzle 23.  Show that \\(  f_{\\ast}: PX \\rightarrow PY \\) is the right adjoint of \\(  f^{\\ast}: PY \\rightarrow PX \\).\nWhat's amazing is this.   Here's another way of describing our friend \\(f_{!}\\).  For any \\(S \\subseteq X \\) we have\nf_{!}(S) = \\{y \\in Y:  x \\in S \\textrm{ for some } x \\textrm{ such that } y = f(x)\\} .\nThis looks almost exactly like \\(f{\\ast}\\).   The only difference is that while the left adjoint \\(f{!}\\) is defined using \"for some\", the right adjoint \\(f{\\ast}\\) is defined using \"for all\".   In logic \"for some \\(x\\)\" is called the existential quantifier \\(\\exists x\\), and \"for all \\(x\\)\" is called the universal quantifier \\(\\forall x\\).  So we are seeing that _existential and universal quantifiers arise as left and right adjoints!\nThis was discovered by Bill Lawvere in this revolutionary paper:\n\nF. Willam Lawvere, Adjointness in foundations, Dialectica 23 (1969).  Reprinted with author commentary in Theory and Applications of Categories 16 (2006), 1-16.\n\nBy now this observation is part of a big story that \"explains\" logic using category theory.\nTwo more puzzles!  Let \\( X \\) be the set of states of your room, and \\( Y \\) the set of states of a thermometer in your room: that is, thermometer readings.  Let \\(f : X \\to Y \\) map any state of your room to the thermometer reading.\nPuzzle 24.   What is \\(f_{!}({\\text{there is a living cat in your room}})\\)?  How is this an example of the \"liberal\" or \"generous\" nature of left adjoints, meaning that they're a \"best approximation from above\"?\nPuzzle 25.

There\nare various ways to get our hands on such a poset.  One way is to\nstart with a set \\( X \\) and build a poset \\( P X \\) whose\nelements are subsets of \\( X \\).  This leads to the most traditional\nform of logic, called classical logic.  But another way is to start\nwith a set \\( X \\) and build a poset \\( \\mathcal{E}(X) \\) whose\nelements are \"partitions\" of \\( X \\).  This leads to another form of\nlogic, called the logic of partitions.\nWhat's a partition?  It's a way of chopping the set \\( X \\) into\n\"parts\".  We want each part to be a nonempty subset of \\( X \\), we\nwant these parts to be disjoint, and we want their union to be all of\n\\( X \\).  For example, here are all 52 partitions of a set with 5\nelements:\n\n\nAt the top we see the \"coarsest\" partition, where all 5 elements are\nin the same part.  At the bottom we see the \"finest\" partition, where\neach element is in its own separate part.\nHow can we think of these partitions as \"propositions\"?  Here's how: each partition gives a proposition saying that two elements in the same part are \"equivalent\", or the same in some way.  The coarser the partition, the more elements are equivalent.  \nFor example, imagine you're a detective trying to solve a case on a\nsmall island with 5 people on it.  At first you don't know any of them\nare related, so they're all in separate families, as far as you know:\n\n\nBut then you start digging into their history.  Each time you learn\nthat two people are related, you change your partition by putting them\ninto the same part:\n\n\nYou keep doing this as secret family relationships are revealed:\n\n\nSo as you learn more, you \"climb up the poset of partitions\", moving\nto coarser and coarser partitions.  That's how it works in partition\nlogic.\nLet's make this precise!  A partition of \\(X\\) is a bunch of subsets\nof \\(X\\). So, it's a subset of \\(P(X)\\).  Please think about that\nuntil it makes sense, or ask questions!  There are a lot of sets and\nsubsets running around: it can be confusing.  But here we go:\nDefinition.  A partition of a set \\(X\\) is a set \\(P \\subseteq P(X)\\) such that:\n\nEach set \\(S \\in P \\) is nonempty.\n\nDistinct sets \\(S, T \\in P\\) are disjoint: that is, if \\(S \\ne T\\) then \\(S \\cap T = \\emptyset \\).\n\nThe union of all the sets \\(S \\in P\\) is \\(X\\): that is,\n\n\n  X = \\bigcup_{S \\in P} S \nWe call the sets \\(S \\in P\\) the parts of the partition.\nI said that each partition \\(P\\) gives an equivalence relation,\nwhere two elements of \\(X\\) are \"equivalent\" if and only if they're\nin the same part.  Let's make that precise too:\nDefinition. An equivalence relation on a set \\(X\\) is a relation \\(\\sim\\) on \\(X\\) that is: \n\nReflexive: for all \\(x \\in X\\), \\(x \\sim x\\).\n\nTransitive: for all \\(x,y,z \\in Z\\), \\(x \\sim y \\) and \\(y \\sim z\\) imply \\(x \\sim z\\).\n\nSymmetric: for all \\(x,y \\in X\\), \\(x \\sim y\\) implies \\(y \\sim x.\\)\n\n\nPuzzle 28. Show that if \\(P\\) is a partition of a set \\(X\\), and we define a  relation \\(\\sim_P\\) on \\(X\\) as follows:\n   x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ if and only if }  x, y \\in S \\textrm{ for some } S \\in P, \nthen \\(\\sim_P \\) is an equivalence relation.\nPuzzle 29. Show that if \\(\\sim\\) is an equivalence relation on a set \\(X\\), we can define a partition \\(P_\\sim\\) on \\(X\\) whose parts are precisely the sets of the form\n  S_x = \\{y \\in X : \\; y \\sim x \\}  \nwith \\(x \\in X\\).  We call \\(S_x\\) the equivalence class of \\(x\\).\nPuzzle 31.  Show that the previous two puzzles give a one-to-one correspondence between partitions of \\(X\\) and equivalence relations on \\(X\\).\nPuzzle 32.

For example, any two points in the red part of the picture are equivalent.    \nEven better, every equivalence relation comes from a unique partition.  So, if you want to work with partitions, you can equally well work with equivalence relations.   This makes it easy to define a poset of partitions, which is the key step toward doing logic with partitions. \nHere's how it goes.  For any set \\(X\\), \\( \\mathcal{E}(X)\\) is the set of partitions of \\(X\\).   For any partition \\(P\\) of \\( X \\), let \\(\\sim_P\\) be the corresponding equivalence relation.  \nDefinition.  We say that a partition \\(P\\) of \\(X\\) is finer than a partition \\(Q\\) of \\(X\\) if\n  x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_Q y \nfor all \\(x,y \\in X \\).   In this situation we write \\(P \\le Q\\), and we also say \\(Q\\) is coarser than \\(P\\).\nThis makes it incredibly easy to get our hands on the poset of partitions! \nProposition.  \\(\\mathcal{E}(X), \\le\\) is a poset.\nProof.   We just need to show that the relation \\(\\le\\) is reflexive and transitive.   Since \n  x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_P y \nfor all \\(x,y \\in X \\), we have \n  P \\le P \nso the relation \\(\\le\\) is reflexive.\nIf \n  x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_Q y \nand \n  x \\sim_Q y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_R y \nthen clearly\n  x \\sim_P y \\textrm{ implies } x \\sim_R y \nSo, \n  P \\le Q \\textrm{ and } Q \\le R \\textrm{ implies } P \\le R \nso the relation \\(\\le\\) is transitive.  \\( \\blacksquare \\)\nThat proof was as easy as sliding down a slide covered with grease!   It's what I call a \"follow your nose\" proof - to create it, you just carefully write down what you need to show,  use some definitions to figure out what it really means, and notice that it's true.\nHere's a picture of the poset of partitions of a 3-element set:\n\n\nIt looks simple.  But that's deceptive!  For a 4-element set we get this poset of partitions:\n\n\nIt's much more complicated than the poset of subsets of a 4-element set:\n\n\nIndeed, there are many difficult questions about the poset of partitions that are easy for the poset of subsets.   \nFor example: how many subsets does an \\(n\\)-element set have?    Easy: \\(2^n\\).  But how many partitions does an \\(n\\)-element set have?   Not so easy: it's the \\(n\\)th Bell number \\(B_n\\).  The Bell numbers go like this:\n 1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975, 678570, \\dots \nAnother example: poset of subsets looks the same when you flip it upside down.  That's because any subset \\(S \\subseteq X\\) has a complement\n   X - S = \\{x \\in X : \\; x \\notin S \\} .\nIn the logic of subsets this gives negation: if a subset \\(S \\subseteq X\\) corresponds to some proposition \\(P\\),  its complement \\(X - S\\) corresponds to the proposition \\(\\neg P \\), which is how logicians write \"not \\(P\\) \".\nBut the poset of partitions does not look the same when you flip it upside down:\n\n\nAnd indeed, there is no \"not\" in partition logic!   It's very different than classical logic.   To read more about it, go here:\n\nDavid Ellerman, The logic of partitions: introduction to the dual of the logic of subsets.\n\nPartition logic still has joins and meets, so I'll talk about those next time.   We should also see how a function \\(f : X \\to Y \\) gives a monotone function \\(f^ : \\mathcal{E}(Y) \\to \\mathcal{E}(X)\\).   And we should see if \\(f^\\) has left or right adjoints!   \nThis leads up to the punchline of Chapter 1: the idea of \"generative effects\".  In a nutshell, partition logic has \"generative effects\" because the right adjoint of \\(f^*\\) doesn't preserve joins.  This may sound scary and technical, but as we'll see, it captures a basic fact about reality.\nTo read other lectures go here.\nClick here to read the original discussion.\n"},"chapter_1/lecture_12.html":{"url":"chapter_1/lecture_12.html","title":"Lecture 12 - Generative Effects","keywords":"","body":"Lecture 12 - Generative Effects\n\nClick here to read the original discussion.\n"}}}
